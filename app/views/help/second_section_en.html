<p>The collaboration and communication Kinubi software works with <FONT COLOR="#000"><b> Projects</b></FONT>. </p>

<p><FONT COLOR="#000"><b><i>ï¿½ What is a Project?</i></b></font><br>
In the platform, the word Project is used to refer to any topic where there is communication and exchange of files between more than one person.<br>
A professor can create a Project for his or her math class and invite all the students to join it. He or she can upload the syllabus, lecture notes, open conversations, send them notifications.<br>
For a lawyer, a Project can be a costumer of his or her law office where he or she needs to deliver files about a case, or asking for information for a trial.<br>

For a advertising agency, a Project can be the marketing campaign of a costumer. There the files and requests can be uploaded. <br>

As you can see, a Project can refer to a variety of topics, sectors and different areas.<br>

To make it easy for the user the clasification of the projects that can be related, we have created Group of Projects. Group of Projects is a grouping label of projects, which allows good arrangement of projects within the table of projects.<br></p>

<p>Briefly, the steps to start working on projects is as follows<b><i> Start working on projects</i></b>
